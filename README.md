# PDP-11/UNIX C Compiler by Dennis Richie (1972)

The earliest versions of the very first C compiler, known to be written by the Dennis Richie himself.

Directory **last1120c** is a saved copy of the compiler just before the migration from the PDP-11/20, which did not have multiply or divide instructions, but instead a provided a separate, optional unit that did these operations (and also shifts) by storing the operands into memory locations.

The second directory, **prestruct-c** is a copy of the compiler just before adding structures functionality. 

It's not possible to compile it nowadays with any modern C compilers like GCC, however, in theory there's a probability of success compiling it using PDP-11/UNIX emulator.
